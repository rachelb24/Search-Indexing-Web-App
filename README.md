# Search-Indexing-Web-App
A web application with two key functionalities using Flask and Elasticsearch. 
The first service allows users to upload a CSV file containing student information. This data is then indexed for efficient retrieval. 
The second service enables users to search for students based on a search token, which is compared against all indexed attributes, returning a list of matching students. To ensure the application's functionality, I tested it using Postman.
